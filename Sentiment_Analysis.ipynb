These pre-processing steps play active roles (nearly 70% of our entire process) to help prepare the text data for subsequent analysis and modeling, improving the accuracy and effectiveness of model which we are about to build lately."

        "Using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) from the sklearn library is a powerful technique for text data analysis. TF-IDF assigns weights to individual words in a document based on their frequency and importance within the entire corpus. The sklearn library provides an easy-to-use implementation of TF-IDF, allowing users to transform raw text data into a numerical representation that can be used for machine learning tasks. By calculating the TF-IDF scores, we can identify the most significant words in a document while downweighting common words that appear across multiple documents. This helps in capturing the essence of each document and highlighting the distinguishing features of the text. The TF-IDF representation is particularly useful for tasks such as text classification, information retrieval, and document similarity analysis. By leveraging the sklearn implementation of TF-IDF, we can efficiently process and analyze textual data, enabling more accurate and insightful NLP applications."
